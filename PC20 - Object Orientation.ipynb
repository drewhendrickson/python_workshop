    "The chapters until this point covered an approach to programming that is often referred to as \"structured programming\" or \"imperative programming\", wherein a program is considered a sequence of statements, decisions, and loops. You can solve any programming problem with a structured programming approach. However, in the last decades several other programming \"paradigms\" have been coined up, which help designing and implementing large-scale programs. One of the most successful paradigms is \"object orientation\", and most modern programming languages support the object oriented paradigm. Python is, in fact, an object oriented language.\n",
    "\n",
    "While object orientation tends to provide a natural way to look at problems and solutions, designing an object oriented program can be quite hard. The reason that it is hard, is that you have to really think about your approach to a problem in all of its aspects, before you start coding. For bigger problems, this can be daunting, especially when you lack experience with programming. However, for bigger problems you have to spend a lot of time designing your solution anyway, and an object oriented approach may be quite helpful in creating it. Moreover, you will find that most modules provide object oriented implementations, and that object orientation can be helpful for many smaller problems too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since object orientation is a broad topic, several chapters will be spent on it, of which this one is the first. It discusses the basics of object orientation, leaving the more specialized (and powereful!) aspects of object orientation for later chapters."

    "While I am typing this, I am sitting at my kitchen table. Next to me is a bowl of fruit. There are some apples in the bowl. While these apples share certain features, they have their differences too. They share their name, their price, and their age, but they all have (slightly) different weights. There are also some oranges in the bowl. Like the apples, they are fruits, but they have a lot of differences with apples: different names, different colors, different trees that they grow from. Still, they share some things with apples that all fruits share, and make them different from, for instance, the table I am sitting at. I can eat a fruit, i.e., I can eat apples and I can eat oranges. I am not going to try to eat a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I try to model my world in a computer program, I have to model objects: objects such as apples, oranges, and tables. Some of these objects have a *lot* in common, for instance, each apple shares a lot of features with every other apple. It behooves me to define a class \"apple\" which contains the features that all apples share, and only fill in the few features in which apples differ from each other for each individual apple object. The same holds for oranges, they should get their own class \"orange\". And while \"apples\" and \"oranges\" are quite different, they still share some features that entail that I would like to put them in the same class: the class \"fruit\". Every object that belongs to the class \"fruit\" at least has the property that I can eat it. Which means that each individual apple object not only belongs to the class \"apple\", but also belongs to the class \"fruit\" -- just like the \"oranges\".\n",

    "Come to think of it: I can eat more things than only apples and oranges. I can eat cakes too. And mushrooms. And bread. And licorice -- I love licorice, even though it gives me high blood pressure. So maybe I need another class, which the class \"fruit\" also belongs to. The class \"food\", perhaps?\n",
    "\n",
    "What this leads to, is that if I try to model the world, or part of the world, I need to model objects -- and rather than modelling each separate object, I am better off defining classes of objects, as that means I can make statements about certain groups of objects in general. I can talk about the relationships between classes, and I can define functions that work on classes; for instance, I can define a functionality \"eat\" that works on every object that is part of the class \"food\", which removes the object from the world and assigns its \"nutrients\" to the object that does the \"eating\". Since I can \"eat\" objects that belong to the class \"food\", I can eat \"fruit\". And since I can eat \"fruit\", I can eat any \"apple\" object.\n",

    "Many programs deal with persons. The student administration deals with students, who are persons. These students follow courses, which are taught by teachers, who are also persons. Undoubtedly, the student administration stores information on students and teachers, and probably the programmer who created the software for the student administration was smart enough to create a single interface that allows entering person data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What data do all persons share, as far as the student administration is concerned? Well, probably all persons have a first and a last name. They have an address. They also have an age and a gender. They all get assigned an administration number, so that for the administration they have at least one thing that makes them unique. These data elements are all \"properties\" or \"attributes\" of \"persons\".\n",
    "\n",
    "I mentioned the properties first name, last name, address, age, gender, and administration number. One of these is actually more like a function than a property. Do you see which one?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is \"age\". Age is calculated from date of birth and current date. While you can consider age a property, it is a property that should be calculated each time that it is needed. You cannot store it as a value, as tomorrow it might be different from today, without anything changing but the date. Therefore, if I design a class `Person` that models a person, I best make \"date of birth\" an attribute of the person, while \"age\" is a method of the person. Remember that methods are functions that belong to a certain data type: if a data type `Person` is defined, `date_of_birth` is an attribute of that data type, while `age()` is a method of that data type that returns the person's age as an integer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Students and teachers are both persons. They share the properties of the `Person` class. Yet there are differences. Teachers, for instance, get paid a salary, while students do not. Students, on the other hand, earn grades in courses, which teachers do not; they teach the courses. From this follow two obvious observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- While students and teachers are both persons, they have clear differences; besides a class `Person` I need a class `Student` and a class `Teacher`, both of which are derived from the class `Person`.\n",
    "- \"Courses\" seem to be an inherent part of the student administration world, so a class `Course` might be needed too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once `Course` has become a class in the student administration world, relationships become visible. Students have relationships to multiple courses, and teachers do too, though in a different capacity. Students \"enroll\" in courses. It looks like an `enroll()` method is needed, that allows a student to get into a relationship with a course. The question is: is `enroll()` a method of `Student`, that gets a course as argument, or is it a method of `Course`, that gets a student as argument? What do you think?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is: \"it depends\". It depends on how you envision the student administration world. To me, it feels more natural to make `enroll()` a method of a course, as I view a course as a collection of students. However, in principle there is nothing against seeing a student as an entity who encompasses a collection of courses. You might also decide to make `enroll()` a method of each of them, or think of yet another class that contains the `enroll()` method that has both the student and the course as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustrates the difficulty of the object oriented view on program design: by designing the classes that form the world model that the program works with, choices need to be made that may have a big impact on how the program works. Weak choices may lead to difficulties in implementation. You need to spend considerable time on designing the object oriented model that underlies the program, and try to anticipate all the consequences of your choices. This is hard even for experienced designers. However, a solid object oriented model makes programs easy to read, understand and maintain. The object oriented paradigm is often worth the hassle.  "

When, for instance, a function in a program was designed for instances of `Apple`, you cannot use it with instances of `Fruit`, or other subclasses of `Fruit`.

Like lists, dictionaries, and sets, all the objects that are instances of classes that you define, are \"passed by reference\" to functions and methods.

As discussed before, the `copy()` function of the `copy` module creates a shallow copy; if you want a deep copy, you have to use the `deepcopy()` function.
