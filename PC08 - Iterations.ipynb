It is started at zero, as at the start of the code the user has not yet entered any numbers, so the total is still zero. `count` is used to count how often the code has gone through the loop. Since the loop must be done five times, `count` is started at `0` and the boolean expression for the loop continues until `count` is `5` (or higher). Thus, in the loop `count` gets increased by `1` at the end of every cycle through the loop.\n",

When you continue with programming, you will find that most code sticks to this convention. Most standard programming constructs that use indices or count things apply this convention too. My advice is therefore that you get used to it, as it makes code easier to read.\n",

Write such a loop-and-a-half in the code block below (you will need exactly one `break`, and you need at most one `continue`).
