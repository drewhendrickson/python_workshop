    "When something is wrong with your code, Python will raise errors. Often these will be \"syntax errors\" that signal that something is wrong with the form of your code (e.g., the code in the previous exercise raised a `SyntaxError`). There are also \"runtime errors\", which signal that your code was in itself formally correct, but that something went wrong during the code's execution. A good example is the `ZeroDivisionError`, which indicates that you tried to divide a number by zero (which, as you may know, is not allowed). Try to make Python raise such a `ZeroDivisionError`."

    "The division operator in Python 2 works differently from the one in Python 3. In Python 3, it is automatically assumed that if you use division, you need floating-point numbers, so the division will assume that all numbers involved are floats, and will always result in a float. In Python 2, it is assumed that the division will be of the type that is \"most detailed\" for the numbers involved, i.e., if you divide two numbers and at least one is a float, it will be a floating-point division and the result is a float, but if you divide two integers, it will be an integer division and the result will be an integer (if the resulting number would mathematically have decimals, then the decimals are simply removed). The way Python 2 works is similar to what most programming languages do, but the way Python 3 works is more intuitive and leads to fewer errors."
