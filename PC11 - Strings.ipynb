The brief discussion in that chapter ended with the statement that a string is a text, enclosed by either single or double quotes, which might be of any length, including zero characters long. The chapter also explained that you can concatenate two strings using the `+`, and that you can create a string that is the repetition of a shorter string by using a `*`. For example:"

    "The interesting difference between these two examples is that in the first example, the string was interpreted as one long, continuous series of characters, while in the second example the different lines are all printed on different lines on the output. The reason that this happens is that there is an invisible character included at the end of each line in the second example that indicates that Python should move to the next line before continuing. This is the so-called \"newline\" character, and you can actually insert it explicitly into a string, using the code \"`\\n`\". So this code should not be read as two characters, the backslash and the \"n\", but as a single newline character. By using it, you can ensure that you print the output on multiple lines, even if you use the backslash to indicate the continuation of the string, as was done in the first example. For example:"

    "\"`\\n`\" is a so-called \"escape sequence\". An escape sequence is a string character written as a backslash followed by a code, which can be one or multiple characters. Python interprets escape sequences in a string as a special character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the newline character \"`\\n`\", in a previous chapter I also introduced the special characters \"`\\'`\" and \"`\\\"`\", which can be used to place a single respectively double quote in a string, regardless of what characters surround the string. I also mentioned that you can use \"`\\\\`\" to insert a \"real\" backslash in a string. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides these, there are a few more \"backslash sequences\" which lead to a special character. Most of these are archaic and you do not need to worry about them. The two I want to mention are \"`\\t`\" which represents a single tabulation, and \"`\\xnn`\" whereby `nn` stands for two hexadecimal digits, which represents the character with hexadecimal number `nn`. For example, \"`\\x20`\" is the character expressed by the hexadecimal number `20`, which is the same as the decimal number `32`, which is the space (this will be explained later in this chapter).\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you never learned about hexadecimal counting: hexadecimals use a numbering scheme that uses 16 different digits, namely `0` to `9`, and `A` to `F`. A direct translation from hexadecimals to decimals turns `A` into `10`, `B` into `11`, etcetera. In decimal counting, the value of a multi-digit number is found by multiplying the digits by increasing powers of `10`, from right to left, e.g., the number `1426` is `6 + 2*10 + 4*100 + 1*1000`. For hexadecimal numbers you do the same thing, but multiply by powers of `16`, e.g., the hexadecimal number `4AF2` is `2 + 15*16 + 10*256 + 4*4096`. Programmers tend to like hexadecimal numbers, as computers work with bytes as the smallest unit of memory storage, and a byte can store 256 different values, i.e., any byte value can be expressed by a hexadecimal number of two digits.\n",
