    "There are two broad classes of computer programs: \"compiled\" programs and \"interpreted\" programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a program in a compiled language, you write the program, then compile it, which turns it into a new program file which contains machine code. Machine code is unreadable by humans, but computers can execute it really fast. Examples of compiled computer languages are C++ and C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a program in an interpreted language, you write the program, and you can then run it immediately, without the need to turn it into machine code in a separate process. Instead, the interpreter will turn each line of code into machine code on the fly, when it needs it. Examples of interpreted languages are Python and Perl.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of languages have their advantages and disadvantages. I do not need to discuss these. The only thing you need to know is that to run Python programs, you need a Python interpreter installed on the machine where you wish to run the programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Python interpreters are freely available for almost every machine in existence. Visit <a href=\"http://www.python.org\">python.org</a> to download a Python interpreter for your computer. For this course, make sure that you get a Python 3 interpreter. Install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now write and run Python programs on your machine without the need of notebooks. If you want to run a program that you wrote on a different machine, you can just copy it to the new machine. If the new machine has a Python interpreter installed, your code will also run on the new machine, even if it uses a different operating system (unless it uses features that are particular to a specific operating system, of course, but in general your code will run without the need for adaptations)."

    "Python programs are created in the form of files. By convention, the name of the file that contains a Python program has the extension \".py\".\n",

    "Most Python installations (definitely those for Windows and Mac OS) also install an environment to create programs in, which is called IDLE. They usually also create some access point for the IDLE environment (for instance, and icon or link on the desktop or in a program menu). IDLE is a quite bare, but suitable environment to do your programming in.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start IDLE, you are in a so-called \"Python shell\". This is, as it were, an interactive Python program, in which you can type lines of Python code, which are run immediately. For instance, if you type `print(7/4)`, IDLE will show you the answer 1.75. In general, this is not how you wish to create and run code, but you can use the shell to quickly test the effect of Python statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write Python programs with IDLE, you can create new Python files, or open existing Python files, using the \"File\" menu. IDLE then gives you a new window in which you can write code, edit code, and save code. You can even run the code immediately from this window, using the \"Run\" menu (there is a shortcut key to immediately run the program, usually F5). The program then actually runs in the shell, so that is where you supply input and can see the output. Make sure that you save your programs with a name that ends in \".py\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are user-friendlier ways to create Python programs. What you need is a text editor, preferably one that supports writing Python code specifically. Note that a text editor is different from a word processor; a text editor has no formatting options. You might see text getting formatted while typing in a text editor, with bold, italics, and colors, but this is so-called \"syntax highlighting\", which shows for a particular programming language how certain words that you type are understood by the program. Syntax highlighting is also done for the code in these notebooks, for instance, strings are displayed in a brownish color, while keywords are green.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many text editors available that support writing Python code, for many different operating systems, most of them free. If you are unhappy with IDLE to write code, you can search for alternatives on the Internet. All editors have their own advantages and disadvantages, so what you prefer to use is up to you."

    "\n",
    "For many Python programs, when you activate them in this way, you either see nothing happening, or a quick flash of a black window, after which nothing happens anymore. The reason is that Python programs run in a \"command-line shell\" of the operating system. If you are not a Linux user, this is probably not something that you are used to. Basically, what happens is that Python opens the command-line shell, runs the program, and when the program finishes, closes the shell, giving you the feeling that nothing has happened. But something <i>did</i> happen; you just did not notice it.\n",

You may open the command-line shell (which usually is a somewhat hidden option in the list of installed programs on your machine, falling under System Commands) and \"manually\" run Python programs from that shell, but there seldom is a need to do that."

    "Besides these notebooks, you might occasionally want to reference the Python manual. The easiest way to do that is using the Internet. Just search for \"Python\" with whatever you are interested in, and you will quickly see links that lead straight into the Python manuals. You might also run into links that lead you to code that solves a problem for you directly. While that is great by the time you have to use Python for practical problems, it does not help you to learn. So my advice is that you avoid such links during this course.\n",

If you search for that title, different versions will pop up. Be careful that you select a book that uses Python 3, and not Python 2.\n",

Downey is one of the best books to learn from that I know of, but unfortunately is, at the moment of this writing, written for Python 2. Downey has announced a Python 3 version for 2016. Python 3 versions of this book have already been created by others, notably by Peter Wentworth, though he has imprinted his own teaching philosophy upon the book, which I do not always agree with. Still, it is a reasonably good book to learn from.\n",

    "Besides books and these notebooks to learn Python from, there are several open video courses available. I have not checked these out, as they are time consuming, and I believe that it is not possible to learn programming from watching a video. The only way to learn programming is by doing. I find the notebooks particularly appealing as they allow us to let you practice while I give explanations by text. But, as they say, YMMV."
