    "When working with program code, very often you are designing a procedure (or \"algorithm\") that solves a problem in a general way. For instance, in the previous chapter one of the exercises had you calculate the wholesale price for a stack of books, for a given book price and a given number of books. The code you wrote did not solve this problem for a general case, but only for the specific case of 60 books costing 24.95 per book. If you want to write code that solves problems in a more general way, you need to use variables that store values. "

    "- Programmers <i>never</i> choose variable names that are also the names of functions (whether they are functions provided by Python or functions they wrote themselves). Doing so will cause the corresponding function to be no longer accessible by the code, and may then lead to rather eccentric errors.\n",
    "- Programmers try to choose variable names that are in some way meaningful to the code. For instance, a variable that stores the number of seconds in a week, might have the name `secs_per_week`, but not the name `i_hate_my_job`. It would be even worse to name a variable that contains the numbers of seconds in a week `secs_per_month`.\n",
    "- An exception to choosing meaningful variable names is choosing names for \"throw-away\" variables, i.e., variables that you only use in a very small section of the code and that are no longer needed afterwards, and that have no good meaning by themselves. Programmers usually choose a single-letter name for such variables. For instance, if a variable is needed to quickly count to 100, after which it is not needed anymore, programmers often choose the letter `i` or `j` for such a variable. \n",
    "- To avoid confusion with capitals and lower case letters, programmers tend to use only lower case letters in variable names.\n",
    "- If a variable name is chosen that consists of multiple words, programmers put one underscore between each of the words.\n",
    "- Programmers never choose variable names that start with an underscore. Such variable names are considered reserved for the authors of the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
