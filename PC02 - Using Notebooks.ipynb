    "You can run this code by clicking on it so that it gets selected, and then press <i>Ctrl+Enter</i>. Alternatively, you can click on the button at the top of the page with the \"forward\" image on it. Do that now, and you will see the text \"Hello, world!\" appear beneath the code. Anything that a piece of code prints, is shown beneath it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You even have the ability to change the code, and see what happens if you change it. For instance, in the code above, change the text \"Hello, world!\" to something else (but make sure you leave the double quotes in place, and do not use double quotes in your own text). Run the code, and see how it displays your own text. Be aware, however, that this actually changes your notebook; you cannot simply revert back to the original version of the notebook, unless you upload or copy a \"clean\" version. You can make copies and/or create \"checkpoints\" for the notebook in the \"File\" menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Most students appreciate that notebooks store the changes that they make to them, but are feeling a bit uncertain about leaving a notebook without actually pressing a save button somewhere. Luckily, such a save button exists: you find it as the most left of the icons at the top of the page. \n",
    "\n",
    "If for some reason you want to clear the output that you generated by running code, you can click on the menu choice \"Cell\" at the top of the screen, then select \"All Output\" and \"Clear\". Or, if you just want to clear the output of one piece of code, select it by clicking on it, then choose \"Cell\", \"Current Output\", \"Clear\".\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, it is also possible for you to change the texts of the notebooks. When you double click on a text, or sometimes by accident \"scroll\" into the text from code, suddenly the text is shown on a grey background and with different formatting. You can return the text to the regular visualization by \"running it\" (pressing *Ctrl+Enter*). I would love to lock the texts, but in the current version of the notebooks that is not possible. I am sure that we get that feature in the future, but for now we have to make do."

In fact, it looks like a variable (variables will be introduced in one of the early real programming lessons), but since this variable has no value, Python cannot use it.

The answer is: \"Nothing\". There is no difference. However, by running the previous bit of code, you created a variable `hello` and filled it with the value \"Hi!\". So that variable exists now, and it can be printed, even in other bits of code on this page. That is the consequence of this whole notebook page actually running as if it is one big piece of code.\n",

    "Even better (or worse, whichever way you look at it), if you now run the first piece of code again, which gave an error message, now suddenly it no longer gives an error message. Because it, too, can now make use of that variable `hello` that was created.\n",

At that point, the box in which you can type input is gone, but none of the code on the page will run, because the notebook is actually <i>still</i> waiting for input.

Anything you changed in the notebook will be preserved, but the kernel for the notebook is no longer running. Even better, when you finished working, if you choose \"Logout\" at the top right of any notebook page, you will be logged out of the system and all your notebooks are closed automatically.
