    "You will notice that for a dictionary, the code gives an answer almost immediately, while for a list it takes quite some time for the code to provide an answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is that I use the `in` operator to check whether a number is in the list, or in the dictionary. For a list this means that Python searches through the list, sequentially, until it reaches the number or reaches the end of the list. In this case, it means that Python checks 10000 times 10000 numbers (as it cannot find any of them), which is 100 million numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a dictionary, the process of finding a key is much faster. Python can quickly decide whether or not a key is in a dictionary. Usually, the checking of just a handful of numbers suffices. Therefore, the code is much, much faster for a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think that a couple of seconds for the list search is still negligible, but the search time increases quadratically with the size of the data. Depending on the problem, using a dictionary might be highly preferable over using a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, lists take less memory than dictionaries, and if you can directly access a list item via its index, lists are faster than dictionaries. For instance, in the problem above, if the list is sorted you can find numbers on it in a smarter way than using the `in` operator (checking about 14 indices would suffice) -- in that case, a list may be faster again.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, you should remember that a list is fast if you can access its elements directly via their index, while a dictionary is a much better choice if the main way to find something is by scanning items. The `in` operator seems easy and reads well, but if you use it to seek something in a long list, you better think again."
