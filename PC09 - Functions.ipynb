    "Why would you want to create a function? There are several different reasons why you want to have a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may need a particular functionality for your code that you want to develop in independence of the rest of the code. If you put such a functionality in a function, that means that after developing and testing the functionality you can use it without thinking about it anymore.\n",
    "- You may need a particular functionality that returns in different places in your code, and rather than copy it to all these places, you write a function for it which you call in all these places.\n",
    "- You may need a particular functionality in your code that you need to control using parameters. If you put it in a function, the parameters become clearer and the code becomes more readable and easy to maintain.\n",
    "- Your program may just be getting too long to keep a solid grasp on its contents, and you feel you can improve readability and maintainability by splitting off inherently connected blocks into functions.\n",
    "- You may have problems solving a big problem in one go, and decide to divide it into sub-problems (which is usually a good idea). You can now create a function for each of these sub-problems, and by connecting them together, solve the big problem.\n",
    "- Your program may contain deeply nested conditions or loops, and would benefit enormously as far as readability is concerned by moving some of the deeper nestings into functions.\n",
    "- You may want to re-use code in different programs, and functions are a good way to transfer code between programs.\n",
    "- You may want to release some of your code to other programmers, and functions are, again, a good way to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the advantage of functions is that they provide a means to effectuate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Encapsulation*: Wrapping up a piece of useful code in such a way that it can be used without knowledge of the specifics\n",
    "- *Generalization*: Making a piece of code useful for a variety of circumstances by controlling it via parameters\n",
    "- *Manageability*: Dividing a complex program into easy-to-manage chunks\n",
    "- *Maintainability*: Using meaningful names and logical wrappings to make a program better readable and understandable  \n",
    "- *Reusability*: Facilitating the transfer of functionalities between programs\n",
    "\n",
    "A final advantage is that functions allow the use of a technique called \"recursion\", but I will spend a separate chapter on that."

While programming courses often encourage students to write comments in code, I myself am of the opinion that code should be \"self-documenting\", i.e., that you can easily derive from code what it does simply by reading it. You can accomplish that often by choosing strong names for variables and functions, judiciously using whitespaces and empty lines, good indenting (which Python enforces), and not using any convoluted trickery just because it makes the code a little bit faster or to show off how smart you are.\n",

    "So while I see comments as an extra that you should use when you feel you need to explain something particular about your code, my opinion on comments for functions is different. The idea behind a function is that the user of the function does not need to look at the function's code to use it. Therefore, what the function does and how it works, should be explained in comments at the top of the function, above the function name.\n",

It is part of Python because it is also part of other programming languages, in particular functional programming languages such as Lisp and Haskell, which rely on the concept of anonymous functions. But the `lambda` keyword in Python is not as powerful as the `lambda` keyword in these other languages, and, as we have seen, not really needed.
