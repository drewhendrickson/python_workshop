    "To extend a subclass with new methods, you can just define the new methods for the subclass. If you define methods that already exist in the parent class (or \"superclass\"), they \"override\" the parent class methods, i.e., they use the new method as specified by the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, when you override a method, you still want to use the method of the parent class. For instance, if the `Student` class needs a list of courses in which the student is enrolled, the course list must be initialized as an empty list in the `__init__()` method. Yet if I override the `__init__()` method, the student's name and age are no longer initialized, unless I make sure that they are. You can make a copy of the `__init__()` method for `Person` into `Student` and adapt that copy, but it is better to actually call the `__init__()` method of `Person` inside the `__init__()` method of `Student`. That way, should the `__init__()` method of `Person` change, there is no need to update the `__init__()` method of `Student`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of calling a method of another class: by using a \"class call\", or by using the `super()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class call entails that a method is called using the syntax `<classname>.<method>()`. So, to call the `__init__()` method of `Person`, I can write `Person.__init__()`. I am not limited to calling methods of the superclass this way; I can call methods of any class. Since such a call is not a regular method call, you *have* to supply `self` as an argument. So, for the code above, to call the `__init__()` method of `Person` from the `__init__()` method of `Student`, you write `Person.__init__( self, firstname, lastname, age )`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `super()` means that you can directly refer to the superclass of a class by using the standard function `super()`, without knowing the name of the superclass. So to call the `__init__()` method of the superclass of `Student`, I can write `super().__init__()`. You do *not* supply `self` as the first argument if you use `super()` like this. So, for the code above, to call the `__init__()` method of `Person` from the `__init__()` method of `Student`, you write `super().__init__( firstname, lastname, age )`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these two approaches, I prefer the use of `super()`, but only in this specific way: to call the immediate superclass in single-class inheritance. `super()` can be called in different ways and has a few intricacies, which I will get to below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, the class `Student` gets two new attributes: a program and a course list. The method `__init__()` gets overridden to create these new attributes, but also calls the `__init__()` method of `Person`. `Student` gets a new method, `enroll()`, to add courses to the course list. Finally, as a demonstration I overrode the method `underage()` to make students underage when they are not 21 yet (sorry about that)."

    "You can create a class that inherits from multiple classes. This is called \"multiple inheritance\". You specify all the superclasses, with commas in between, between the parentheses of the class definition. The new class now forms a combination of all the superclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a method is called, to decide which method implementation to use, Python first checks whether it exists in the class for which the method is called itself. If it is not there, it checks all the superclasses, from left to right. As soon as it finds an implementation of the method, it will execute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to call a method from a superclass, you have to tell Python which superclass you wish to call. You best do that directly with a class call. However, you can use `super()` for this too, but it is pretty tricky. You provide the order in which the classes should be checked as arguments to `super()`. However, the first argument is not checked by `super()` (I assume that it is supposed to be `self`).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is something like this: You have three classes, `A`, `B`, and `C`. You create a new class `D` which inherits from all other three classes, by defining it as `class D( A, B, C )`. When in the `__init__()` method of `D` you want to call the `__init__()` methods of the three parent classes, you can call them using class calls as `A.__init__()`, `B.__init__()`, and `C.__init__()`. However, if you want to call the `__init__()` method of one of them, but you do not know exactly which, but you do know the order in which you want to check them (for instance, `B`, `C`, `A`), then you can call `super()` with `self` as the first argument and the other three classes in the order in which you want to check them (for instance `super( self, B, C, A ).__init__()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "As I said, it is pretty tricky. Multiple inheritance is tricky anyway. My general recommendation is that you do not use it, unless there is really no way around it. Many object oriented languages do not even support multiple inheritance, and those that do tend to warn against using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I am not even going to give an example of using multiple inheritance, and neither am I going to supply exercises for multiple inheritance. You should simply avoid using it, until you have a lot of experience with Python and object oriented programming.

The application will have a map containing all possible points and connections between the points. It will also have a list of vehicles, with certain vehicles being restricted to specific points, and connecting only specific points (e.g., planes will only be available at airports, and only connect to specific other airports, while boats are only found in harbors and connect to specific other harbors). The application gets a start and end point as input, and provides a list of the sort: take the car to drive from start point to point X, take the plane to fly from point X to point Y, take the bus to drive from point Y to point Z, and then walk from point Z to the end point.\n",

To be able to come to an optimal travel plan, it must know for each vehicle at what points it is available, to what points it can travel, and the average speed of travel (so that you do not get a travel plan that says \"walk from Amsterdam to Moscow\"). It might also be a good idea to include a verb that is used when the plan refers to travel with a vehicle (e.g., \"walk\", \"drive\", or \"fly\"). You might need to think a lot about how to implement such vehicles. A possible approach is to supply each vehicle with a method that gets a point as argument and that returns whether or not the vehicle is available at that point, a method that gets a point as argument and that returns whether or not the vehicle travels to that point, a method that gets two points and returns the average speed of travel of the vehicle between those two points, and a method that returns the verb (I am not saying that this implementation is a good idea, just that it could potentially be used).\n",
