If the user enters anything else, except for a single question mark (`?`), the program considers what the user entered a new element and appends it to the queue.

    "The sieve of Eratosthenes is a method to find all prime numbers between 1 and a given number using a list. This works as follows: Fill the list with the sequence of numbers from 1 to the highest number. Set the value of 1 to zero, as 1 is not prime. Now loop over the list. Find the next number on the list that is not zero, which, at the start, is the number 2. Now set all multiples of this number to zero. Then find the next number on the list that is not zero, which is 3. Set all multiples of this number to zero. Then the next number, which is 5 (because 4 has already been set to zero), and do the same thing again. Process all the numbers of the list in this way. When you have finished, the only numbers left on the list are primes. Use this method to determine all the primes between 1 and 100."

Keep track of who the current player is using a global variable `player` that you can pass to a function as an argument if the function needs it. I also use a function `opponent()`, that takes the player as argument and returns the opponent. I use that to switch players after each move.\n",

    "Create a program that is a simplified version of the game \"Battleship\". The computer creates (in memory) a grid that is 4 cells wide and 3 cells high. The rows of the grid are numbered 1 to 3, and the columns of the grid are labeled `A` to `D`. The computer hides a battleship in three random cells in the grid.

If the cell contains a battleship, the computer responds with \"You sunk my battleship!\", and removes the battleship from the cell (i.e., a second shot at the same cell is a miss). As soon as the player hits the last battleship, the computer responds with displaying how many shots the player needed to shoot down all three battleships, and the program ends.\n",
